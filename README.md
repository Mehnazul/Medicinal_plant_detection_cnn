# Medicinal Plant Leaf Classification using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based web application that classifies medicinal plants from their leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Once a leaf image is uploaded, the system predicts the plant species and displays its medicinal properties, common uses, and usage instructions.

## üåø Project Highlights

- Image classification using CNN trained on a custom dataset of medicinal plant leaves.
- Flask-based web interface for user-friendly interaction.
- Supports 40+ medicinal plant species, including Tulasi, Neem, Aloe Vera, Ashwagandha, and more.
- Provides details like:
  - Medicinal properties
  - Common health benefits
  - Instructions for safe usage

## üß† Model Details

- Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Input: Leaf image (RGB, resized to fixed dimensions)
- Output: Plant species (Multi-class classification)
- Training: Trained on labeled dataset of medicinal leaf images
- Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy on validation and test sets

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset

- Includes images for 40 classes of medicinal plants.
- Each class has 100‚Äì200 labeled images.
- Data Augmentation techniques were used to improve generalization.
- Amruta_Balli, Amla, Aloevera, Arali, Ashoka, Ashwagandha, Avocado, Bamboo, Basale, Betel, Betel_Nut, Brahmi, Castor, Curry_Leaf, Doddapatre, Ekka, Ganike, Geranium, Guava, Henna, Hibiscus, Honge, Insulin, Jasmine, Lemon, Lemon_grass, Mango, Mint, Nagadali, Neem, Nithyapushpa, Nooni, Pappaya, Pepper, Pomegranate, Raktachandini, Rose, Sapota, Tulasi, Wood_sorel
